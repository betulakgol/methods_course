function matlab_hw()

% 1. When finding the number of elements in a vector
% (i.e., a one-dimensional matrix), what is the difference 
% between the output of "length" and "size"? 

 1. Size gives the number of dimensions(columns and rows) in a matrix, length gives 
the maximum number of dimensions of the matrix. 

% 2.  Describe in words (and without plugging into MATLAB directly) what...

3.m,n >2 so only m =3, n=3.n=4 will be using as a variable. It will create two 
matrix I and J. After we add I and J to X seperately we created two different 
version of X matrix and subtract the second matrix from the first matrix. 
It convert I,J,and p to emty matrix and do the same process for the second variable.
% 4. If A is defined as "A = [4 5 6; 1 2 3; 7 8 9]", what ...

4. A.^2 finds the multiplication on each number with itself.
A^2 multiplies the matrix with itself
